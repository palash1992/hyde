title: Graph Embedding Lab
---

Graph Embedding Lab (GEL) is a platform to faciliate reasearch on graph embedding/ network representation. It has libraries for graph embedding on static, dynamic and attributed graphs. Further, it contains data sets traditionally used for graph embedding evaluation. The libraries are written in Python and C++ for ease of testing. Finally, recent works on graph embedding is being regularly scraped and categorized into categories and displayed in the [Recent Works](http:palash1992.github.io/gel/recent) section.

### Static Methods
Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Dynamic Methods

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

### Attributed Methods

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.
